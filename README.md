There are two versions of rag-llm:

- The **_test** version includes tests for non-Langchain architecture, Langchain architecture, and various functions.
- The **_v2** version refactors the code to make it clearer and cleaner, also using Langchain.

In the **_v2** version, you can start the program by using the command `python run.py`.
